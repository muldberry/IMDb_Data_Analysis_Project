DATA PROCESSING
In this section, we present the main data analyses and visualizations conducted on the IMDb dataset. Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, was utilized to perform the analyses and generate visualizations.

1. Analysis of Movies with Long Runtimes:
We identified movies with runtimes of 180 minutes or more and displayed their titles. This analysis provided insights into the duration of movies and allowed us to explore any patterns in their popularity.

2. Average Voting and Revenue Trends Over the Years:
We calculated and visualized the average voting and revenue for each year in the dataset. This analysis helped us understand how voting and revenue evolved over time.

3. Influence of Directors on Movie Ratings:
We examined the average rating for each director to determine how directors influenced movie ratings.

4. Top 10 Longest Movies:
We displayed the titles and runtimes of the top 10 longest movies.

5. Number of Movies Released Each Year:
We analyzed the number of movies released each year to observe any trends in movie production.

6. Movie with the Highest Revenue:
We identified the movie with the highest revenue and displayed its title.

7. Top 10 Movies with the Highest Rating and Revenue:
We visualized the top 10 movies with the highest rating and revenue, along with their directors and actors.

8. Relationship Between Movie Ratings and Revenue:
We examined the relationship between movie ratings and revenue using a scatter plot.

These analyses and visualizations provided valuable insights into the IMDb dataset and allowed us to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations related to movies, their ratings, revenue, directors, actors, and genres.
